            <h1>Daft Punk</h1>
            <p>
                Daft Punk is a multi Grammy Award-winning electronic music duo formed in 1994 in Paris, France, and consisting of French musicians Thomas Bangalter (born 3 January 1975) and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo (born 8 February 1974). The band is considered
                one of the most successful electronic music collaborations of all time, both in album sales and in critical acclaim.<br><br>

                Daft Punk reached significant popularity in the late 90s house movement in France, along with other artists such as Air, Cassius, and Dimitri From Paris. Daft Punk are credited with producing songs that were considered essential in the French house
                scene. They were managed from 1996 to 2008 by Pedro Winter (Busy P), the head of Ed Banger Records.<br><br>

                The group released four studio albums: Homework (1997), Discovery (2001), Human After All (2005), and Random Access Memories (2013). They also released the soundtrack album TRON: Legacy (2010); the live albums Alive 1997 (2002), Alive 2007 (2007);
                the compilation Musique Vol. 1 1993â€“2005 (2006); the remix albums Daft Club (2003), Human After All: Remixes (2006), TRON: Legacy Reconfigured (2011).
